        I&apos;m a student at GIAIC, learning about exciting new technologies like
        AI, the Metaverse, and Web3.0. I study how these tools can shape the
        future, from smart machines to apps that work in new ways. I love
        learning how these ideas can make fun and useful digital experiences for
        people.
